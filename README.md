# Slidrr

Developers know a lot of tools to generate presentations based upon Markdown.   
I was curios if I could build it with Haxe.

This is a WIP repos.

# Build

You need Haxe!

install

`haxelib install markdown`


```
cd to/this/folder (replace with your own path)
haxe build.hxml
open -a Google\ Chrome http://localhost:2000/
nekotools server
```


# Markdown

Markdown, created by John Gruber, author of the Daring Fireball blog. 
The original source of Markdown can be found at Daring Fireball - Markdown.



# Navigation

Cleaver supports keyboard navigation for switching between slides. Alternatively, click the control buttons located below the presentation.

To navigate the slideshow:

forward: K, L, UP, RIGHT, PgDn, and Space
reverse: H, J, LEFT, DOWN, PgUp, and Backspace
The toggle fullscreen mode, press the ENTER key.
